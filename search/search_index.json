Each combination of options for a product is a variant for that product. For example, suppose that you sell T-shirts with two options: size and color. The size option has three values: small, medium, and large. The color option has two values: blue and green. One specific variant from these options is a small, blue T-shirt. You can see how many variants a product has in the Inventory column of the Products page. For products that don't have any variants, the Pricing, Inventory, and Shipping sections are shown on the product details page.

When a customer checks out, they can choose to pay for their order using any of the methods that you've enabled in the Payment providers area of Shopify. You can enable a variety of payment methods using Shopify. There are a few different things to consider when you're choosing which payment methods to offer. If you want to let your customers pay using a credit card, then you can use Shopify Payments or a third-party provider. There are also several ways for customers to pay online without using a credit card, like PayPal, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay. You might also want to accept alternative methods of payment like cryptocurrency. When choosing a payment provider, consider the countries where your business is located and where your customers live.

Although tax laws and regulations are complex and can change often, you can set up Shopify to automatically handle most common sales tax calculations. You can also set up tax overrides to address unique tax laws and situations. Shopify uses many default sales tax rates, which are updated regularly. If you use the default rates, then you need to confirm that they are current and correct for your particular circumstances. You can override them whenever necessary. Shopify doesn\u2019t file or remit your sales taxes for you. You might need to register your business with your local or federal tax authority to handle your sales tax. The calculations and reports that Shopify provides should help make things easier when it\u2019s time to file and pay your taxes. You should always check with a local tax authority or a tax accountant to make sure that you charge your customers the correct sales tax rates, and to make sure you file and remit the taxes correctly.
